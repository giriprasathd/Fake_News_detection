Fake news is a serious problem that can have serious consequences. From influencing political elections to causing panic and harm in communities, the spread of fake news can have far-reaching and damaging effects. This is why it is important to have tools and systems in place to help detect and prevent the spread of fake news.

The Fake News Detection project aims to provide a tool for detecting fake news articles. By using advanced machine learning techniques, our system is able to analyze the text of an article and predict whether it is likely to be real or fake. This can help individuals and organizations make informed decisions about the content they consume and share, and help reduce the impact of fake news on society.
